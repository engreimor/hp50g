# hp50g-code

###Description###

Some code written when I was a civil engineering undergrad. Maybe it helps someone. 

Sorry but the code is not commented nor translated.

###How to use###
You'll need HPUserEdit IDE to view/edit/test code. This used to be available at [HpCalc](hpcalc.org).

Another useful application is TGV Editor, also available for free at HpCalc.
