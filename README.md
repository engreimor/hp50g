# hp50g-code
Some code written in College.
Maybe it helps someone, maybe not.


Sorry but the code is not commented nor translated.

###How to use###
You'll need HPUserEdit IDE to view/edit/test code ( or any other editor combined with a real calculator or an emulator ). 

This used to be available at [HpCalc](http://www.hpcalc.org/).

Another application that worth mentioning is TGV Editor, also available for free at [HpCalc](http://www.hpcalc.org/).
